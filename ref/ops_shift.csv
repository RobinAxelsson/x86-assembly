Mnemonic,Description,Operands,Notes
SHL,Shift bits left,dest -count,Zero-fill vacated bits - multiplies by 2^count.
SAL,Shift bits left (identical to SHL),dest -count,Preferred for signed arithmetic - same as SHL.
SHR,Shift bits right (logical),dest -count,Zero-fill vacated bits - divides unsigned by 2^count.
SAR,Shift bits right (arithmetic),dest -count,Preserves sign bit - divides signed by 2^count.
ROL,Rotate bits left,dest -count,Wrap-around from MSB to LSB.
ROR,Rotate bits right,dest -count,Wrap-around from LSB to MSB.
RCL,Rotate bits left through CF,dest -count,Includes CF in rotation - useful for multi-word shifts.
RCR,Rotate bits right through CF,dest -count,Includes CF in rotation - useful for multi-word shifts.
