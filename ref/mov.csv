Mnemonic,Description,Operands,Notes
MOV,Move data between registers/memory,dest -src,Versatile - does not affect flags.
MOVSX,Move with sign extension,dest -src,Extends a smaller value to a larger signed value.
MOVZX,Move with zero extension,dest -src,Extends a smaller value to a larger unsigned value.
XCHG,Exchange data between operands,dest -src,Swaps values of dest and src.
PUSH,Push value onto the stack,src,Decrements RSP and stores src at the new stack location.
POP,Pop value from the stack,dest,Loads value from the stack into dest and increments RSP.
LEA,Load effective address,dest -src,Computes address from memory operands without accessing memory.
CMOVcc,Conditional move based on flags,dest -src,Copies src to dest if condition cc is met.
MOVAPS,Move aligned packed single-precision floats,dest -src,For SSE - requires 16-byte alignment.
MOVUPS,Move unaligned packed single-precision floats,dest -src,For SSE - handles unaligned memory.
MOVDQA,Move aligned packed integers,dest -src,For SSE2 - requires 16-byte alignment.
MOVDQU,Move unaligned packed integers,dest -src,For SSE2 - handles unaligned memory.
